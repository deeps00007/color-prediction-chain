## ?? How to Play

It takes 1 minute to start playing.

### 1. Connect Wallet
- Click the **"Connect Wallet"** button.
- MetaMask will ask to switch to **Sepolia Testnet** and add a high-speed RPC. **Approve it**.

### 2. Get Gas (Free Sepolia ETH)
You need a tiny amount of ETH to pay for transaction fees (Gas). Use a faucet to get it for free:
- [**Google Cloud Faucet**](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia) (Fastest)
- [Alchemy Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia)
